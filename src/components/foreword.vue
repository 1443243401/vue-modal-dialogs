## Introduction

Dialogs are a typical and essential user interaction in interactive applications.
But implementing dialogs are not an easy thing in front-end web development.

vue-modal-dialogs is a super light-weighted library aimed to
help developers to easily use dialogs by the advantage of [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org),
[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise), and
[async function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function).

This example will walk you through all features and all available usages of vue-modal-dialogs. Feel free to submit an issue or PR if you have any ideas.
