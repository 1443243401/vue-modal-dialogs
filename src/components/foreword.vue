## Introduction

A typical and essential type of user interaction is dialogs.
Dialogs are somehow similar to Promise. A dialog will eventually close. A
Promise will eventually resolve. A dialog returns some data when it closes.
So does Promise. It is time to put them together.

vue-modal-dialogs has the magic to turn dialogs into Promises.
Developers can build and control dialogs a lot easier in Vue.js applications.
Especially in some complicated situations like controlling multiple dialogs,
nested dialogs, etc.

This guide will walk you through all features and all available usages of
vue-modal-dialogs. Feel free to submit an issue or PR if you have any ideas.
